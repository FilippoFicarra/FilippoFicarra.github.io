## About Me

ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ During my bachelorâ€™s studies, I realized that the future belongs to AI, not as a replacement for people, but as a way to empower them. From that moment, Iâ€™ve been inspired to contribute through research and development, advancing progress one step at a time.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve taught and written my thesis at ETH and worked at IBM, experiences that helped me see how theory and practice come together. Beyond research, I love turning learning into teaching. Iâ€™ll plan to post regular lessons and reflections on this site, a space to share insights, explore ideas, and keep curiosity alive. 

When Iâ€™m not building or studying AI, youâ€™ll often find me playing guitar and singing, cooking new recipes, or climbing mountains. 
I believe that creating, learning, and exploring, both in and out of the lab, are what make life meaningful.
